# Basic Strategy
- Always select the starting wingers, flyhalf and fullback of the team playing against Italy
- Captain the higher rated winger
- Scrape betting odds off oddschecker to understand which teams are more likely to win and using this pick more players from the expected winning team. Put players from less likely team to win on the bench.
- Scrape the starting lineups off six nations fixtures website so that always choose players who are starting, always choose 18 players who are starting
- Use selenium to automate logging into six nations fantasy and scrape off all available players, their cost, position, team etc. and my remaining budget, such that a squad can be selected
- aim to maximise spending on each round (expect this to pick the better players)
