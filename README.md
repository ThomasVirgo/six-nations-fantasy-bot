# Basic Strategy
- Always select the starting wingers, flyhalf and fullback of the team playing against Italy
- Captain the higher rated winger
- Scrape betting odds off oddschecker to understand which teams are more likely to win and using this pick more players from the expected winning team. Put players from less likely team to win on the bench.
- Scrape the starting lineups off six nations fixtures website so that always choose players who are starting, always choose 18 players who are starting
- Use selenium to automate logging into six nations fantasy and scrape off all available players, their cost, position, team etc. and my remaining budget, such that a squad can be selected
- aim to maximise spending on each round (expect this to pick the better players)


# Squad selection
- Italy 0 players
- 3 teams most likely to win, 4 players each = 12 total out of 18
- Leaves 3 players from each of the other teams. Put two on bench for team most likely to lose (choose cheap forwards) 
- fullback, wingers, flyhalf from team playing Italy = 4 players. Total =  4/18
- 1 centre from each team more likely to win from other fixtures = 2 players. Total = 6/18
- Choose scrum half from team most likely to loose. Total = 7/18
- Two forwards from team most likely to loose on bench. Total = 9/18
- One forward from other team likely to loose on bench. Total = 10/18. Bench Complete.
- Hooker from team most likely to win. Total = 11/18
