# Basic Strategy
- Always select the starting wingers, flyhalf and fullback of the team playing against Italy
- Scrape betting odds off oddschecker to understand which teams are more likely to win and using this pick more players from the expected winning team
- Scrape the starting lineups off six nations fixtures website so that always choose players who are starting, always choose 18 players who are starting
- Use selenium to automate logging into six nations fantasy and scrape off all available players, their cost, position, team etc. and my remaining budget, such that a squad can be selected
